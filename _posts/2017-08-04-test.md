1. Blah blah blah

    **Note:** The following sample is an excerpt of the StatefulSet file.
    {: .notice1}

    ```yaml   
    # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
    # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
    # reopened with the relevant failures.
    #
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
     creationTimestamp: 2016-08-13T18:40:58Z
     generation: 1
     labels:
     app: cassandra
     name: cassandra
     namespace: default
     resourceVersion: "323"
     selfLink: /apis/apps/v1beta1/namespaces/default/statefulsets/cassandra
     uid: 7a219483-6185-11e6-a910-42010a8a0fc0
    spec:
     replicas: 3
    ``` 

2. Change the number of replicas to 4, and then save the manifest. 

   The StatefulSet now contains 4 Pods.
