## Definition and Description of the Lego Brick Separator

### What is it and what is its function?

The Lego Brick Separator is a hand tool that helps you separate Lego pieces. From Bricks to Plates to Tiles 
to even Technic rods, this tool helps you separate Legos from the top or underneath. No more stuck or broken 
pieces. No more teeth marks or scratches. The Lego Brick Separator lets you easily pull apart any Lego pieces 
without a scratch. 

### What does it look like?

The Lego Brick Separator is a 5.5 x 5.5 x 0.1 inches tool made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, a common 
thermoplastic polymer. It resembles other Lego pieces and can even be used within builds.

### What are its principal parts?

#### The Tile Remover:

* Physical Description: It looks like a flathead screwdriver being used as a wedge.
* Dimensions: 5.5’’ x 0.1’’
* Function: Pry apart tile and other non-studded pieces

#### The Ridged Handle:

* Physical Description: Seven ridges lined up in a 4’’ x 0.5’’ section at a 35° angle
* Dimensions: 4’’ x 0.5’’
* Function: Allows a strong, angled grip for maximum torque

#### The Technic Remover:

* Physical Description: It’s a short Axle Rod attached to a flat base.
* Dimensions: 2x1 Lego Stud
* Function: Separates Technic Axles and Pins from Lego Beams and Gears 

#### The Lower Brick/Plate Remover:

* Physical Description: A small ⅓ indentation on the top of the tool
* Dimensions: 2x1 Lego Plate
* Function: Separates Plates from Bricks and other studded pieces 

#### The Upper Brick/Plate Remover:

* Physical Description: A small ⅓ indentation on the bottom of the tool
* Dimensions: 2x1 Lego Plate
* Function: Separates Plates from Bricks and other studded pieces

### How does it work?

This 4-in-1 tool works thanks to physics, specifically the way wedges amplify force, 
how fulcrums extend the center of rotation to create leverage, and the Pauli 
exclusion principle. 

Without getting too much into the alphabet-ridden mathematics, the wedge (Title Remover) 
simply allows more pressure to separate the Lego pieces by reducing movement.

Similarly, the Upper and Lower Brick/Plate Removers act as extensions to the pieces they connect 
to and create a mechanical advantage that cannot be achieved by fingernail or tooth alone. The 
two different pressures on the Lego pieces ultimately help to pull the pieces apart: downward 
pressure keeps the Lego Separator connected to the Lego piece and backward pressure separates 
the pieces. 

Lastly, the Pauli exclusion principle basically says matter cannot occupy the same space as other
matter. For the Technic Remover, this principle means that it just pushes the other piece out of 
place.
